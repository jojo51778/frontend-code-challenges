### 1. the React Counter app
As the first React problem, you are asked to create the famous Counter app.

1. counter starts from 0.
2. click the '+' button to increment.
3. click the '-' button to decrement.

This is a very easy question. 
You can see my github file [src/views/Counter.jsx](https://github.com/jojo51778/react-code-questions/blob/main/src/views/Counter.jsx)

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <div className="card">
        <p>count is {count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>+</button>
        <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count - 1)}>-</button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```
